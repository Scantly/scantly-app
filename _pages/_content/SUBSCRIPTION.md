To use this app in your organisation, you will need a __subscription__.

You can choose to subscribe on a __monthly__{:.bg-dark .text-white .p-1 .rounded-lg} or __yearly__{:.bg-success .text-white .p-1 .rounded-lg} basis.

Yearly subscriptions are better value than monthly subscriptions, and also benefit from the ability to request / suggest __priority__ features and include users outside your domain.

All payments are handled securely through Stripe, and all major payment cards as accepted. You can cancel your subscription at any time, although we do not offer refunds for unused periods of service (e.g. if you cancel early) although you can continue to use the service until the end of your billed period.
